# Next.js 15 Hydration Mismatch Bug
This repository demonstrates a common hydration mismatch error in Next.js 15 applications when fetching data from an API route within a component. The error occurs because the component tries to render using data that hasn't been fetched yet, resulting in a mismatch between the server-side render (SSR) and the client-side hydration.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the `/about` page.
5. Observe the hydration mismatch error in the browser's console.

## Solution
The solution involves using asynchronous rendering techniques like `Suspense` and `Promise`. These components handle asynchronous operations, such as data fetching, and gracefully display loading indicators or fallback content until the data is available, preventing hydration mismatches.  The solution is implemented in the `aboutSolution.js` file.
